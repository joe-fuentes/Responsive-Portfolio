      <img src="assets/images/mypic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Joe Fuentes">

      <p>I was born in Jacksonville, Florida. Shortly after, our family moved to the Philippines. I was raised by my mother while in the Philippines. After graduating from high school, I returned to Jacksonville to live with my father. It was quite an adjustment moving from a "third-world" country, especially when my English was quite rough, it sounded like I was swallowing my tongue as I spoke. As soon as I landed back here in the United States I started my first job at McDonald's flipping burgers.</p>

      <p>I received my Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from UCF. Worked as an attractions operator at Walt Disney World and, later, got a job as an engineer, hopping from one company to another - gaining field experience anywhere I can.</p>
